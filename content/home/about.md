I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley. I previously worked in the Household and Real Estate Finance Section at the Federal Reserve Board. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2010 with a B.A. with Honors in Economics.

I am currently on the the job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA Annual Meeting in Philadelphia, PA (January 5th-7th, 2018).

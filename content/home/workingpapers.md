**Common Ownership in the Loan Market**

<a class="btn btn-primary network-icon" style="width:10  0px;" href="files/Ojeda_BankingCommonOwnership.pdf">PDF</a>

<small><p style="line-height: 1.3em;">Firms and banks increasingly have institutional investors as shareholders in common. These shareholders not only receive profits through interest rates, but also benefit from firm profits. In this paper, I first illustrate the implication of firm and bank common ownership on loans in a simple model. I then provide new evidence of the rise and extent of common ownership between firms and banks. I next show that a firm that borrows from a bank with common owners obtains a lower interest rate and a larger loan. I use the growth of index funds as a source of exogenous variation to estimate a plausibly causal link between common ownership and loan terms not confounded by unobserved factors such as strategic investments by active institutional investors. I find that a one standard deviation increase in common ownership leads to a five basis point interest rate decrease and a three percent loan size increase. I show that these loan terms do not go to underperforming firms but to firms that are less likely to receive a credit rating downgrade. I also find that better loan terms are more pronounced for smaller and unrated firms. This suggests that common ownership benefits may be due to decreased information and monitoring frictions for the lender if their shareholders also have access to firm returns and information.</small></p>

**Why Small Firms Fail to Adopt Profitable Opportunities** (with [Paul Gertler](http://www.paulgertler.com/), [Sean Higgins](http://www.seankhiggins.com/) and [Ulrike Malmendier](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~ulrike/))
<small><p style="line-height: 1.3em;">Why do small firms often fail to adopt new profitable opportunities, even in the absence of informational frictions, fixed costs, or misaligned incentives? We explore three potential mechanisms: present bias, memory, and trust in other firms. In partnership with a financial technology (FinTech) company in Mexico, we randomly offer firms that are already users of the payment technology the opportunity to be charged a lower merchant fee for each payment they receive from customers. The median value of the fee reduction is 3% of profits. We randomly vary the size of the fee reduction, whether the firms face a deadline to accept the offer, whether they receive a reminder, and whether we tell them in advance that they will receive a reminder. While deadlines do not affect take-up, reminders increase take-up of the lower fee by 18%, and anticipated reminders by an additional 7%. The results point to limited memory in firms, but not present bias. Additional survey data suggests trust as the mechanism behind the significant additional effect of the anticipated reminder. Upon receiving an anticipated reminder from the FinTech company, firms value the offer more and accept it even if they generally distrust advertised offers. </small></p>

**Digital Sales and Inventory Data to Assess Creditworthiness** (with [Paul Gertler](http://www.paulgertler.com/), [Sean Higgins](http://www.seankhiggins.com/) and [Ulrike Malmendier](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~ulrike/))
<small><p style="line-height: 1.3em;">Small merchants in developing countries often do not adopt technology to accept digital payments from credit or debit cards, or track inventory. As a result of low adoption, important data on creditworthiness is lost. Especially for small merchants with limited credit histories, this lack of information leads banks to assess creditworthiness in a costly and imprecise manner through on-site visits. In close collaboration with a private bank, we are piloting a technology that bundles the capability to digitally track sales and inventory through an app, accept digital payments, and optionally provide newly generated data on digital revenues and inventories to banks to increase access to affordable credit. Through focus groups, surveys and transaction data, we are currently determining what improvements should be made to the technology to improve take-up and usage before scaling it up. Pilot results will inform a full-scale field experiment to analyze how high-frequency digital data on sales and inventory can help small merchants signal their creditworthiness, and thereby improve their access to finance and grow. Pilot completed. More information:  [CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/evidence/incentivizing-small-merchants-in-emerging-markets-to-adopt-digital-payment-technologies/)</small></p>

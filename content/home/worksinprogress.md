**Digital Sales and Inventory Data to Assess Creditworthiness** (with [Paul Gertler](http://www.paulgertler.com/), [Sean Higgins](http://www.seankhiggins.com/) and [Ulrike Malmendier](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~ulrike/))
<small><p style="line-height: 1.3em;">Small merchants in developing countries often do not adopt technology to accept digital payments from credit or debit cards, or track inventory. As a result of low adoption, important data on creditworthiness is lost. Especially for small merchants with limited credit histories, this lack of information leads banks to assess creditworthiness in a costly and imprecise manner through on-site visits. In close collaboration with a private bank, we are piloting a technology that bundles the capability to digitally track sales and inventory through an app, accept digital payments, and optionally provide newly generated data on digital revenues and inventories to banks to increase access to affordable credit. Through focus groups, surveys and transaction data, we are currently determining what improvements should be made to the technology to improve take-up and usage before scaling it up. Pilot results will inform a full-scale field experiment to analyze how high-frequency digital data on sales and inventory can help small merchants signal their creditworthiness, and thereby improve their access to finance and grow. Pilot completed. More information:  [CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/evidence/incentivizing-small-merchants-in-emerging-markets-to-adopt-digital-payment-technologies/)</small></p>
